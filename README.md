# Introduction
The task is to provide analytical support to its anti-money-laundering compliance department. This will involve a variety of data-related projects that help the bank assess client risk and transaction risk, as well as reporting on metrics. You’ll also help build and optimize models that assist the bank i n running their compliance program more efficiently. Many challenges await you that will test your technical skills and ability to handle data-related ethical dilemmas.

# Objectives

This Achievement will introduce a variety of new concepts and processes, many of which fall under the realm of advanced data analytics. Don’t worry if you don’t get everything right away, as you’ll revisit some of these more complex topics in Achievement 6.

Below are just a few of the topics you’ll encounter:

- The characteristics of big data, how data analysts use big data, and the challenges of extracting knowledge from big data
- The impact of data bias and ethics on how data is used, shared, collected, and protected
-The fundamentals of data mining, including techniques for data mining and how it drives decision-making
- Predictive analysis and models such as linear regression
- Time-series analysis and time-series forecasting
- The basics of GitHub and how you can use it to refine your skills, collaborate with colleagues, and display a portfolio of work
- What to include in your portfolio when applying for jobs

# Context

Data analytics is an exciting profession if you’re curious, enjoy problem-solving, and want to make a difference. Indeed, the satisfaction of being able to measure your impact and drive decision-making i s what attracts many to the profession. The amount of data that’s being analysed is minuscule compared to the amount of data that’s being produced. We’ve not even begun to scratch the surface of big data, which is growing rapidly. While machine learning can certainly help in this area, vast amounts of knowledge and insights are still waiting to be found by those with the right skill set and know-how. 

Technology and an interconnected world are vastly increasing the amount of data collected. Everything from how much it rained in Seattle last year to how many text messages were sent worldwide and the most-watched movies on Netflix all become part of big data. However, how data is collected, used, and shared can be harmful to both
individuals and society. Data collected on individuals, in particular, comes with responsibility. For these reasons, the data analyst should be guided by a strong ethical foundation and be able to discuss ethical concerns with their coworkers and employer.

Besides being aware of data ethics and knowing how to raise ethical concerns with stakeholders, the data analyst needs to know how to derive useful information from big data.
This is where data mining, predictive analytics, and time-series analysis and forecasting come into play.

Finally, the data analyst needs to understand GitHub. Not only is GitHub the standard for any data analyst portfolio, but it’s also a great way for analysts to collaborate on projects and learn from others in the industry. What’s more, displaying your SQL and Python skills on GitHub will impress future employers and serve as proof that you have the skills they require when applying for jobs.
